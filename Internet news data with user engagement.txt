Context
This dataset was created and used in order to determine the popularity of an article before it was published online but thanks to its flexibility can be used in various tasks.

Content
The internet news data was collected between 03.09.2019 and 04.11.2019 (DD.MM.YYYY). It contains articles (listed as the top in popularity at the publisher website) from multiple well-known publishers. Then using Facebook GraphAPI data was enriched with engagement features such as shares, reactions, and comments count.
